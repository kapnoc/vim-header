# vim-project

A really basic plugin I use for my personnal projects. Right now, it handles my headers & indentation (Different styles for different projects).

Being as basic as it is, it allows for easy customisation, so feel free to use it for your own needs, and share your modifications if you believe them worth it.
I shall keep on adding what I personnally need to it, and add some documentation along the way.

The idea (and most early code) comes from [Le-Bit/vim-epitech](https://github.com/Le-Bit/vim-epitech)
